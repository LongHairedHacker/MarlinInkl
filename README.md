# Marlin 3D Printer Firmware for the ChaosInkl 3D Printer

This repository contains our special blend of Marlin, intended to be used **only** with our 3D printer.
If you have never heard of ChaosInkl before you should probably try the upstream [Marlin](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin) instead.

## Quick Information

This is a firmware for reprap single-processor electronics setups.
It also works on the Ultimaker PCB. It supports printing from SD card+Folders and look-ahead trajectory planning.
This firmware is a mashup between [Sprinter](https://github.com/kliment/Sprinter), [grbl](https://github.com/simen/grbl), and many original parts.

## License

Marlin is published under the [GPL license](/Documentation/COPYING.md) because We believe in open development.
Do not use this code in products (3D printers, CNC etc) that are closed source or are crippled by a patent.
